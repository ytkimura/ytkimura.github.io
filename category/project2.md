## Plant Chemical Database

To better understand the evolution of plant metabolic network, we will build a phylochemical database on which various plant natural products will be mapped onto the plant tree of life. 

This is being conducted with students from the Maeda lab and classroom. 

*[The database will be made available here in the near future.]*
